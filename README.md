OOP and Data Structures projects

OOP_Game is a course project for the Object-Oriented Programming course at FMI.
A game in which the user controls a hero in a 2D map, collects different items
and fights different monsters.  The game has a save/load feature.

DS_MazeSolver is a course project for another course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of Sofia University -Data Structures.
This is an application which finds a path(if existing) in a maze and prints instructions for getting out 
of it on the screen. The labyrinth has different rooms, each room is similar to a chess board -
a rectangular matrix of cells, which may be passable(passage-way) or not(some obstacle, a 
wall, a chasm). The information for each room of the maze is located in a text file, which 
contains the matrix and pairs of symbols describing doors and the keys which unlock them.
